# About Me
Hi Iâ€™m Diana, I am a beginner, currently learning how to code. I don't have a coding backround and didn't know what coding was before I started the bootcamp.  A friend told me about coding and it sounded interesting to me. I did a few code excercises and decided it would be something I could apply my current skills to.   

I switched careers from a Design oriented role in Jan 2020 and have loved my time in code. Over the past year I've been working for a small early stage startup where I've been able to rapidly grow and expand my knowledge. I love working with React, Typescript and/or Javascript, Node.js, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. I'm passionate about photography and design and truly believe that learning never stops.
